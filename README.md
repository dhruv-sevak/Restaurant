This project involves developing a restaurant administration system. The project (this part and the following parts) includes some of the functionalities of similar real-world restaurant systems, but not all. Specifically, the project will focus on two aspects:
1.	Managing the restaurant staff members (e.g., employment information, hours, pay, ratings, etc.).
2.	Customers and orders information
The users of the system will be the administrative staff of that restaurant.
